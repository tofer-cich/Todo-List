# Todo-List
My todo list project.

## New Techniques Used
- webpack bundle
- classes
- modules

## List Item Properties
- title
- description

## Projects
UI will display projects as cards with open and delete buttons. 
When "open" is clicked the screen will remove all projects and display the 
todo list for that project. A back button will let the user return to the projects if need be.
When "delete" is clicked the entire project will be removed from the project list.
